# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation was that this website would help me to code better and would be a quick reference for any questions I had. I learned about the basics of bulding a html, css, and Javascript file. I also learned how to navigate through Github.

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
